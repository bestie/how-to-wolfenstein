# Kata: the game of Wolfenstein 3D

The source of the kata is the ancient game of Wolfenstein 3D, similar to Doom,
albeit less sophisticated. You can find out more
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).

## The map

The map can be as simple as you like, a corridor or square room will suffice.
Doors, items and other features can be omitted.

## Game play

* You walk around a dungeon which you see from a first-person point of view.
* Movement can be controlled via the usual WASD keys and arrow keys
* You should be able to see walls but not walk through them
* Each map (one is fine) should have a goal which when reached the level ends
* Enemies, AI and shooting are quite complex so can be omitted.

## Objective

Write a program that allows you to play a pseudo 3D first person dungeon game
in the style of Wolfenstein 3D.

No GUI is needed, but a primitive command-line display would be helpful for the players.

## Credits

This is satire based on the "Three men's morris" code interview that some of
you may have been subjected to.
