# Kata: the game of Wolfenstein 3D

The source of the kata is the ancient game of Wolfenstein 3D, similar to Doom,
albeit less sophisticated. You can find out more
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).

This is obviously a joke but I have made a start.

Some notable points:

- Written in Ruby
- No dependencies other than than the Ruby interpreter
- No graphics, ASCII art only
- Runs in a terminal emulator (Windows users - send patches)
- Has tests
- There's a demo mode

This is nothing more than a fun side project for me to explore games and
terminal application programming.

# Try it out

```
$ bin/start
```

For point-of-sale display purposes the demo is great:

```
$ bin/demo
```

## Demo scripts

For those unfamiliar with terminal application programming there is a directory
of demo scripts that 'demonstrate' how raw mode and control codes can be used.
